        <p>The core element of the UC2 project is a simple cube.<br>The cube consists of two halves and houses a sliding insert.<br>The insert can hold various optical components (e.g. lenses, mirrors), which means that different functions can be implemented with each cube.</p>

        <p>The UC2 cube can also be 3D printed. It looks the same as the injection molded model, but here it consists of a cube lid and the cube body, which are held together with screws. The screws are great for being put on the magnetic plate. By combining different cube modules, different optical structures can be easily assembled. A new function can be added with each dice. Your creativity knows no limits.</p>

        <p>In ray optics, light is represented as a bundle of rays (arrows), which simplifies the physical properties of light. A ray has a direction and is therefore drawn with an arrow. A lens &#34;refracts&#34; the beam, changing its direction.</p>
<p>The <strong>focal length</strong> of a lens corresponds to the distance from the lens to the focal plane on which the focal point lies. It is given in millimeters (f = mm).</p>

        <p>You can find the focal length of the lens as a printed number on the lens holder. The MiniBOX receives a 100mm converging lens, two 40mm converging lenses and a -50mm negative lens. The numbers indicate the focal length.</p>
<p>The converging lens is also called a positive or convex lens. The middle part of the lens is always thicker than the edge.</p>
<p><br>The converging lens enlarges the image. The magnification is different for the 40mm lens and the 100mm lens. The image can be upright or inverted.<br></p>
<p>The negative lens (spreading lens) is sometimes also called a negative or concave lens. The middle part of the lens is always thinner than the edge.</p>
<p><br>With the negative lens (here: -50 mm lens) the image is always reduced and always upright<br></p>
<p>We assume that our lenses are so-called &#34;thin lenses&#34;. This means we can consider them as one plane and not care about their thickness. This makes explanations and calculations much easier.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take the converging lens as an example. We start with an object (green arrow) and see what happens to the rays that start from the top. There are infinitely many rays in all directions, but for drawing the figure the following three rays will suffice:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The <strong>centre beam</strong> (orange) passes undisturbed through the center of the lens.</li>
<li>The <strong>focus ray</strong> (yellow) also starts from the tip of the arrow, but goes through the object-side focus at focal length f. After the lens, it continues at the same height, but now parallel to the optical axis.</li>
<li>The <strong>parallel beam</strong> (red) initially runs parallel to the optical axis, but is then refracted at the lens in such a way that it passes through the focal point on the image side at focal length f.</li>
</ol>
<p>The image is formed where all the rays intersect. The principle is used for all points or the rays of an object emanating from them. Depending on which lens is used and depending on the position of the object, the properties of the image change, such as size, orientation and position.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Image of an object through a negative lens" duration="2">
        <p>In the case of the negative lens, we use the same method to image the ray path. Unlike the case of the converging lens, the image is always reduced and virtual. Magnification depends on the position of the object in front of the lens. Unlike the converging lens, the image is created on the object side and is therefore called a virtual image. You can see it directly with your eyes but not project it onto a screen.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 800.00px" src="img/c23503539d919a3e.png"></p>
<p><br>The way a lens creates an image is predictable by knowing the focal length of that lens. Therefore, a certain distance must be maintained so that you can see the writing with the specified lens on the previous sheet.<br></p>
<p><br>The magnification and the location where the image is formed depend on the focal length of the lens and the distance between the lens and the object.<br></p>
<p><br>With the diverging lens (f = -50 mm) you always see a reduced virtual image. A virtual image can only be viewed with the eye. So far we only have virtual ones<br>seen pictures.<br></p>

<p><br>The magnifying glass is the simplest of all optical devices, since it consists only of a simple converging lens with a suitable focal length. Why does the cube with the 50 𝑚𝑚 enlarge the small text? If the object is in front of the focal length of the lens - i.e. less than 50 𝑚𝑚 in front of the lens - the lens creates a virtual image which is behind the actual object. The eye perceives it enlarged. Check out the diagram above.<br></p>
<p>Calculate the magnification of the magnifying glass using the following formula:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 200.00px" src="img/3719920d37e221aa.png"></p>
<p>250 𝑚𝑚 is the distance of clear visual range - i.e. the distance between the object and the eye at which most people can read well. More on this later in the &#34;accommodation&#34; of the eye.</p>

        <p>Take the UC2 lens cube with focal length 𝑓 =40 𝑚𝑚 and place it behind the sample holder cube. The distance between the object and the lens (i.e. the object distance g) should be approx. 50 mm. If you now illuminate the object with the flashlight, you will see it sharply at a distance of approx. 200 mm on the wall. A cinema projector has a film strip instead of the object and of course a much stronger light source.</p>

<p>When an object is imaged through a converging lens, the position and size of the image depend on the distance (g) of the object to the lens and its focal length (f).<br>The lens equation describes the relationship between image distance (b) and object distance (g):</p>

        <p>A microscope is a device that allows objects to be viewed or imaged at high magnification.</p>
<p>The image is called an <strong>intermediate image</strong> because it is often further enlarged with an eyepiece.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 800.00px" src="img/576e020d2b34c592.png"></p>
<p>The object is roughly in the object-side focal plane of the lens. Thus, all incident rays are converted into a parallel bundle of rays behind the lens. The lens has a short focal length.</p>
<p>The tube lens creates a real image by collecting parallel rays that hit the tube lens in its focal plane. If we place them behind the lens, the object will be imaged from the focal plane of the lens. The tube lens has a longer focal length than the objective.</p>
<p>The image in the plane of the intermediate image is reversed, flipped, enlarged and real. The real image can be seen on a screen.</p>

        <p>Newer microscopes are equipped with so-called &#34;infinity optics&#34;. In this case, the lens does not produce a real intermediate image. The light exits the lens as infinite parallel rays. At the end of the &#34;infinite&#34; tube is a tube lens. This creates an intermediate image, which is then enlarged again through the eyepiece.</p>

<p>The image behind the eyepiece is reversed, reversed, enlarged and virtual. The virtual image can be seen with the eye.</p>
<p>This configuration is very useful in modern microscopes as it allows additional components such as filters to be placed between the objective and tube lens without affecting the optical path.</p>
<p>A filter can be used to change the brightness and color of the image.</p>

<p><br>An eyepiece is actually just a lens that enlarges the intermediate image. It maps the virtual image in such a way that you can see it with your eyes.<br></p>

<p><br>With the mirror you can not only see yourself, but also reflect the incoming light in any direction. So you can fold the optical path and make it more comfortable to work with. The mirror doesn&#39;t affect the magnification, but it does rotate the image in one direction.<br></p>

<p>The lenses of older or smaller microscopes are often so-called finite lenses. They behave like a lens with an extremely short focal length and create an intermediate image behind the lens with an image distance that is defined by the tube length. The tube length is printed and corresponds to 160mm for our lens. The real intermediate image is created there and is enlarged by the eyepiece optics.</p>
<p>Microscopes have the ability to focus or sharpen the object either by moving the object or the lens. Here we move the lens through a simple mechanism. The rotation of the gear is translated into a displacement of the objective lens. For larger movements, you can also move the lens in the rail.</p>

<p><br>The lens is also a converging lens with a short focal length. The 4x lens has a focal length of f=32 mm. When used as a magnifying glass, it has a higher magnification than the 40mm lens. The field of view is sharp but small.<br></p>

        <p>An eyepiece is actually a magnifying glass because it enlarges the intermediate image.

However, with a Ramsden eyepiece consisting of a lens system, the field of view is better because it creates fewer errors at the edge of the field of view. The Ramsden eyepiece consists of two lenses with the same focal length. Its focal length is f Ramsden eyepiece = 3⁄4 f lens</p>

        <p>The smartphone camera has a lens with a very short focal length because it has to fit into the thin smartphone. The lens then creates an image on the camera sensor whose properties are similar to those of the human eye.</p>
<p>The eye can see objects from both a distance and near. This property is called accommodation.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 800.00px" src="img/7d2b1151e7d9c90d.png"></p>
